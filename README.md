### âœ… **ðŸ“Œ LinkedIn Post (Final Version)**

ðŸš€ **Just completed my Customer Segmentation project using K-Means Clustering!**

This project was a great hands-on experience with **unsupervised machine learning** to understand customer behavior through data.

ðŸ§  **What I Did:**

* Used customer data (Annual Income & Spending Score)
* Applied the **Elbow Method** to find the optimal number of clusters
* Built a clean **visualization** of the segmentation
* Developed a **Gradio-based interactive frontend** to upload data and run clustering
* Deployed the project on **Google Colab**

ðŸ”§ **Tech Stack:**
`Python Â· scikit-learn Â· Pandas Â· Matplotlib Â· Gradio Â· Google Colab`

ðŸ“¸ **Project Preview:**
*(Insert Screenshot of the clustering plot or Gradio app interface)*

ðŸ”— **Try it yourself / View Code:**
ðŸ‘‰ GitHub Repository: \[your GitHub link]
ðŸ‘‰ Run on Colab: \[your Colab link]

ðŸ“Œ **Key Takeaways:**

* Mastered the implementation of K-Means from scratch
* Explored customer profiling for business applications
* Solved real-world issues like frontend deployment and runtime errors

ðŸ’¡ Next steps: Adding more features (age, gender), and exporting segmented CSVs for targeted analysis.

Would love to connect with others working in **Data Science, ML, or Marketing Analytics**!
